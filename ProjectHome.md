# Sencha Touch 2.0 Demo Project #

Sencha Touch quickly became a recognized development platform for iPhone, Android alternatively. It brings a strong programming model (MVC) and number of patterns. The platform is JavaScript-based though is very broad and most of the required know-how is actually platform specific. Sencha Touch 2.0 is strongly focused on iOS.

This framework enables developers to develop thick clients. All the application logic is injected client-side and executed locally. The application provide number of ways to integrate a back-end logic, providing the data for models.

This project is using node.js platform as back end. It unifies the programming language and thus increase the productivity. Node.js code is stripped down and actually deliver s just JSON object to the thick client.

## Debugging ##

It is highly recommended to install _node-inspector_. That enabled to connect Crome and its development tools with a running instance of Node and debug any script. I is very convenient and mighty feature.
